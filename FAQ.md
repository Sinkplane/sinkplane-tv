1. Why are you using react native and why ... ewww .... typescript?

We are using react native because thats what the existing floatplane app uses.

As far as typescript, as the brits would say, get bent bruv.

2. Are you on LTTs payrol?

Lol I wish

3. Can I use cursor/warp/claude code to contribute.

Sure, but your code will be reviewed along the same criteria as if you were a "real boy" software developer knowing what you are doing. Questions like "how do I get my code pushed into the main repo" or "how do I create a pull request" will be closed without comment.

4. Will you eject to react native?
